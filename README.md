Udemy Modern HTML and CSS From The Beginning.

These projects are written pretty much entirely in HTML and CSS. I used a course online
to learn these concepts before moving on to javascript. The sandbox folders contain
lessons I've worked through, and the other folders contain example websites that I've created
during the class.
